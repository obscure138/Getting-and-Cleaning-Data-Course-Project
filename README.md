# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Data Description
The variables in data X are readings from a smartphone from 30 subjects. The variables in Y are the activity type they were performing.

## Code Explanation
The code combined the training and test datasets. Then it extracted partial variables to create another dataset with the averages of each variable.

## New Dataset
The new generated dataset contained variables calculated based on the mean and standard deviation. Each row of the dataset is an average of each activity type for all subjects.
